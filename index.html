									<h2>About Me</h2>
								</header>


								<p>
									I am currenlty enrolled in the Industrial Design Bachelor program at the Eindhoven University of Technology. Over the past few years I have developed a strong professional identity and design vision that shape my educational journey, which I would like to share with you. 
								</p>

								<header>
									<h3>Identity</h3>
								</header>

								
								<p>
									I would best describe myself as a versatile designer with interests in all sectors of technology and engineering. My interest especially lies in computer technology and the combination with design. I am always eager to learn and largely do this by teaching myself new skills	.
								</p>
									
								<p>
									Technology has been the common theme of my projects and truly the focus of my study. Besides learning design from my projects, I have learned basic engineering knowledge from my other courses. I am also following multiple courses on technology entrepreneurship because I think combining entrepreneurship with product development and technology is an amazing combination. 
								</p>


								<p>
									I like to collaborate with people from different expertise’s in a technical environment, because of how everyone brings their own knowledge and skills to the table. Taking on the leader role is something I find an essential skill in general, and something a designer should be able to do in a tech project. 
								</p>

								<p>
									I am someone who can both work in a project with others, and alone. I enjoy a nice balance between the two and get a lot of motivation from collaboration. I like to learn things on my own by watching videos and by just trying out. I like the hands-on approach to learning a new skill, or to a project. This is why programming and 3D modelling are things that suit me well.
								</p>


								<header>
									<h3>Vision</h3>
								</header>

								<p>
									To me, design is the integration of creativity and ingenuity in any field of work. Especially the design of software is interesting to me. I can imagine myself making an impact with design in the software- and computer application industry. I think that besides complicated algorithms, the design of these programs makes the difference between a sufficient program and an efficient program. Both UI and Human Computer Interaction are the paths I want to explore more in the near future.
								</p>

								<p>
									I think that the society we live in today is going to rely more and more on software, especially in ecommerce. An example of a system like this is online grocery shopping. I find disruptive developments like these extremely fascinating because I think these changes will have positive effects on society in terms of sustainability and efficiency. I would like to shape my expertise set in a way that I can be a part of this, and play a role in changing the world.
								</p>

								<p>
									The designer I strive to be is versatile and has a good understanding of the design process.
									 Being creative and sympathetic are the two key traits that form the basis of a good designer.
									  For me, design for the user is very important, I find nothing more irritating than a poorly designed UI.
									   It takes empathy and social skills to process the users’ needs into a project and I think I have the ability to do so.
									To me, the basis of every design is a user and a problem. I am a natural problem solver and that is exactly what I like so much about the design process.

							<p>“1 in 10 people with epilepsy get a seizure-related injury, from which the most common injury being head injuries. Our project, HEXO, is a smart impact safety helmet, that protects the users from the impact of a fall in a discrete way. HEXO creates the perfect balance between being lightweight, breathable, strong and safe. Not only does it protect the users, it also measures the impact of a fall and identifies the location of the impact. Based on our user survey, one of the main concerns regarding using a safety helmet,  is that it makes their epilepsy visible to others. Therefore, HEXO allows the users to cover up the helmet with their own head accessory, making the design fashionable and personalizable. After a fall, the data is displayed on a website in an overview. Users can choose to send it to a doctor for further consideration if necessary.”<br><br>
								HEXO was a very inspiring project that allowed me to work closely together with epilepsy patients and experts. I like projects that are related to healthcare because it can really positively impact people’s lives and allows me to have a close connection with the user. I taught myself a lot about IoT in this project and managed to host my own server on the esp-32 microcontroller. I finished this project with excellence and the project got featured on the Dutch Design Daily media platform.

							<p>In the course Smart to Touch, I learned about materials and the combination with smart technologies. With Connecklace, I explored the values of jewelry and the experience that goes along with this. The jewlery is connected to the corresponding piece of a loved one and is programmed to replicate the heartbeat of the other using vibrations. The project focusses on the UX and that is why we thought out the product from top to bottom. </p>

							<p>With Moduleery, we designed a system of foam plates that alert caregivers when an elderly person has fallen down. I like how this allowed me to get in the skin of the user and figure out how to help them combat this problem. <br><br>
								For this project I was placed in a multidisciplinary team of all sorts of engineers. I am truly passionate about working in such a team as a designer. I think being a designer means being able to think about the entire experience for all stakeholders, and helping your team accomplish these necessities in their own line of work. Nonetheless, I took on most responsibility for the technology because my skills are developed toward prototyping and applying in the real world. This was my first experience with creating an actual app and connecting it with Bluetooth. This sparked a lot more IoT related experiences in the future.

								<h2>Party Cube</h2>
							</header>

							<p>Party Cube is a multiplayer party game that is designed to bring friends together in times of COVID. For this project, my team and I researched values that come about in multiplayer games and what makes them so much fun. With a focus on the end-user we created a persona and sketched out level designs, and iteratively tested the minigames. A lot of thought went into the score system and balancing the game in a fun way. The game is developed in Unity and allows for real multiplayer gameplay for 2-4 players. <br><br>

								The game focusses on a strong theme that is used to create a coherent game feel. For this we used the Rubik’s cubes and lava. This allowed for some funky level designs and unique game mechanics.

						<p>Because of my interest in business, I am following the Technology Entrepreneurship trajactory over the course of my second year. Thus far I have had some cool projects that taught me a lot about entrepreneurship. Ranging from a challenge of turning 5 euros into as much profit as possible in 24 hours, to collaborating with businesses to analyze the role of entrepreneurs in established firms.<br><br>
							Having a solid business understanding allows me to take this with me in my designs and create for both the user, and for business.<br><br>
							The project I want to highlight is the app FriendsFirst. The app is created with the LEAN methodology and the business model in mind. The app is a social media network that enables first year university students to meet new people from the same university and plan activities together. In a market study, 21% of target users tried to download the app.

								<h2>Intuitive Coffee Machine</h2>
							</header>

							<p>The intuitive coffee machine is my earliest project out of the six, and displays the core of the Industrial Design program I am following. Even though my interests go out to digital design, Industrial Design mostly teaches interaction through physical products. This coffee machine incorporates important design principles like affordance, feedback, and visibility. The device is designed for business people with a busy schedule. The device senses whether or not the user is in a rush, and pours the coffee accordingly. This can either in a rush, or taking its time. </p>
